<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class="book-content">Welcome to this quick book on how
to make your own battle gaming long sword.  The instructions are written with
young people in mind.  Individuals who are high school aged, and who are many
middle school aged will be able to complete this project with minimal or no
parent supervision.  For a younger child, the parent should lead the project.
All parents should read the instructions before letting any minor (regardless
of age) construct this project in order to assess their child’s competence in completing
the project safely. </p>

<p class="warning-content">
Padded weapon safety is dependent upon many factors including, but not limited
to, materials used, construction techniques, and quality of workmanship.  Use
of these guidelines alone will not guarantee the resulting padded weapon can be
safely used in mock combat.  All weapons should be inspected by a knowledgeable
individual and judged for safety and integrity before use in mock combat.</p>
