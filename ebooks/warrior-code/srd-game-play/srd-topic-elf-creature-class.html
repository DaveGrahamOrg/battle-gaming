  <p>Name: Elf</p>
<p>Description: The Elf in the Warrior Code is based on the hu-man sized elves as originally found in Irish fairy legends.  These creatures were distinctly defined by J.R.R. Tolkien in his Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This vision of the elf creature was adapted to Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer as well as World of Warcraft.  The Elf is a crea-ture of grace and beauty.  They are extremely honorable, treat others with great respect and wish to be treated with respect also.</p>
<p>Base Class: None</p>
<p>Clothing Required: A tunic or shirt of better quality than just a T-tunic. Elves wear leather boots.</p>
<p>Experience or Training Required: None</p>

<p>Weapons Classes: No hinged weapon may be used</p>
<p>Shield Classes: As per player class</p>
<p>Armor Classes: Any in good condition (not shoddy)</p>
<p>Special Equipment Needed: Rubber pointy ears</p>
<p>Standard Actions: Elves always must accept a request of Call for Honor Duel. When they know of such a dual in progress they are to prevent the interference of others in the dual.</p>
<p>Creature Class Actions: </p>
<p>Light Magical Healing Act on Self– An elf may heal one light wound upon herself during each of her game lives.  To heal the light wound, she must stand still and touch a wounded target zone and recite a poem of 60 syllables. The elf may not move during the process. The healing eliminates one light wound on the target zone. The healing has no effect on mortal wounds.</p>
