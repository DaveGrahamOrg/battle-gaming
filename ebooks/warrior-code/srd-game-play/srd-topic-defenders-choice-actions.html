  <p>
    <strong>
      <a name="Stop and Block"/>Stop and Block</strong> – The defender consents to a mid field collision and possible knock down by stepping in to stop and block a Run-by Attack.  The attacker consents to the risk of a mid field collision with a possible knock down by initiating the Run-by Attack. </p>
<p>
    <strong>
      <a name="Form a Shield Wall"/>Form a Shield Wall</strong> – A group of four or more defenders can form a shield wall to block the advance of a group of opponents.  The defenders consent to the risk of collision if the shield wall is tight enough to prevent easy passage of the opponent players.</p>
<p>
    <strong>
      <a name="Open Handed Grapple"/>Open Handed Grapple</strong> – Open Handed Grappling is the act of rolling and wrestling on the ground, usually with the goal of having the opponent agree to yield or striking him with a weapon.  Kicking, body locks, nerve pinches, hitting or striking with hands or feet are not permitted in Open Handed Grappling.  To consent to the risk of and to initiate the Open Handed Grapple, an attacker will look at the defender, getting her attention, and saying clearly “Grapple?”  If the defender consents to the risk of the grappling, she will say “Grapple On!” At this point grappling can begin. Players may exchange and use each other’s weapons during Open Handed Grappling.</p>
<p>
    <strong>
      <a name="Call for Honor Duel"/>Call for Honor Duel</strong> –The honor duel is a one-on-one combat amidst the chaos of battle.  For a player to call for honor duel, the player faces a single opponent and calls “Honor?”  The opponent accepts the challenge with “In honor!”  At which point, all other attackers back off and let the challenge go forward.  There is no rule that the other attackers must disengage, but if they are polite, they will uphold the request for the one-on-one duel.</p>
