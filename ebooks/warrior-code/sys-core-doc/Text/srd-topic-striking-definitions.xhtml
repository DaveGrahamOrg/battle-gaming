    <h1>Striking Definitions</h1>
<p><strong>shot</strong> – The act of swinging, throwing, or firing an approved mock weapon at an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>strike</strong> – The act of swinging, throwing, or firing an approved mock weapon at an opponent and making contact with a damage inflicting weapon surface.</p>
<p><strong>tag</strong> – A strike that qualifies to deliver damage to a target zone.</p>
<p><strong>tagged out</strong> – When a player has suffered a death wound and is considered dead.</p>
<p><strong>graze</strong> – A graze is any strike that collides with clothing only. A graze from a handheld weapon does not result in a tag. A graze from a fired weapon does count as a tag as long as the flying projectile changed direction (even slightly).</p>
<p><strong>flat</strong> – A flat is when any non-striking surface of a weapon contacts a player. A flat does not result in a tag.</p>
