    <h1>Target Zone Rules</h1>
<p><strong>Face Strikes</strong> – No weapon shall target or strike an unprotected face. The target player must wear adequate protection to prevent face injury before face target subzone can be targeted and struck during combat.</p>
<p><strong>Head Strikes</strong> – No handheld weapon shall strike an unprotected upper head. The target player must wear adequate helmet protection to prevent head injury before upper head target subzone can be struck during combat.</p>
<p><strong>Head Projectiles</strong> – No projectile weapon shall target an unprotected head unless referees have deemed the projectile adequately padded to prevent injury.</p>
<p><strong>Neck Strikes</strong> – No weapon shall strike an unprotected neck.  Even when neck protection is provided, no player should ever intentionally strike at another player’s neck.</p>
